A cash advance loan is a short-term loan, typically used to help meet pressing urgent cash needs. A payday advance loan charges extremely high interest and repayment is timed to coincide with your next paycheck. In fact, the lender may withdraw the lump-sum repayment directly from your bank account on the due date.

A cash advance installment loan has a lower interest rate and allows you to repay the loan over several months. While these are meant to address short-term cash needs, you may be able to stretch the installment loan repayment period up to 72 months.
