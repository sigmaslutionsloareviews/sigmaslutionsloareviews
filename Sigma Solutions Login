Credit card instant cash advance: This is money you borrow from your credit card, up to the limit set by the card issuer. There is usually a fee, and possibly a higher APR, charged for credit card cash advances. These instant cash advance loans are meant to be very short-term since interest is charged daily starting from the transaction date. You donâ€™t need to receive approval for this type of cash advance; just visit a cash machine or branch of the issuing bank or credit union. This approval bypass is possible because the issuer performed a hard credit check when it approved your unsecured card and set its limits. If you have a secured credit card, you probably escaped any credit checks since your security deposit collateralizes your card balances. You can usually take a cash advance from a secured credit card, which is essentially borrowing from your secured account, at a lower APR than that charged by a similar unsecured credit card. Many credit cards set their cash advance limits well below the overall spending limit. Your monthly statement should show you your limits, along with balances and APRs.
